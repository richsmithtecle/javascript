    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
  let age = 100;
  let age2 = age;
  console.log(age, age2); //returns 100 100
  age = 200;
  console.log(age, age2); //returns 200 100

  let name = 'Wes';
  let name2 = name;
  console.log(name, name2); //returns Wes Wes
  name = 'wesley';
  console.log(name, name2); // returns wesley Wes
  

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    //returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
    //and     ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] 

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);
    //returns ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    //and     ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2); 
    // not entering a range will return a copy of the entire array
    //Any changes to the players array will not be made to the team2 array.

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3); 

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);


    const team5 = Array.from(players); 
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain, person);
    //adds number to captain AND person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    cap2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(person, cap2);
    //to add values while copying:
    cap3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(person, cap2, cap3);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // **** MY CHROME DEV TOOLS DID NOT THROW AN ERROR LIKE WES' DID!!
    const cap4 = {...person};
    console.log(cap4); 
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
